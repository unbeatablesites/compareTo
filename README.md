# compareTo
Write a program that compares several Strings using the compareTo() method. You should display the Strings and display the integer that compareTo() gives you.

You must have five examples which result in a number less than 0, five examples which result in a number greater than 0, and two examples which give you exactly 0. This means you need a total of twelve examples.

You may not just flip the Strings around; you must have twelve different examples.
